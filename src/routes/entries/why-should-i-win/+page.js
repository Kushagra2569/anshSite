				description:
					'What happens when, in the span of a week, you find yourself stranded—no branch head, no manager, no team? Just you and a regional lead, staring at a mountain of expectations with no safety net? Some would tread water, trying to stay afloat. I didn’t. I steered the ship, not just to keep it moving, but to charge against the currents and come out ahead. A true story from my previous organisation. PR isn’t about waiting for direction; it’s about creating impact, no matter the circumstances.  I’ve spent the last four years doing just that—navigating chaos, finding clarity, and delivering results. I’ve worked on powerhouse brands like Cartier, Parle Agro, ITC Foods, Asian Paints, Microsoft, Intel, and L&T Semiconductors. But my real win? Taking a niche B2B deep tech company like Aerospike and making it shine in a space dominated by consumer giants – Best use of Media. When no one expected it, we won. Not just visibility—awards at industry events like PRAXIS, recognition, and a seat at the table where only the biggest names played. Because PR, to me, isn’t about who has the loudest voice; it’s about telling the right story, in the right way, to the right people.  Clients trust me to make their stories heard. Journalists respect the stories I craft. My team knows that when things get tough, I get tougher. In Taylor Swift’s words ‘I am a real tough kid, I for sure can handle my shit’. I don’t just do PR—I live it—with strategy, grit, and making brands matter. And this award? It’s not just for me. It’s for every moment I refused to sink when the tide was against me.',
